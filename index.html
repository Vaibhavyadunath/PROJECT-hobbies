        <p>For a student, a hobby would mean taking some time off from classes and utilizing it for something that he likes to do. A hobby should come to you naturally. It should not be enforced by anyone. If it has to be enforced upon you then, you will soon lose interest in it. The main purpose of a hobby would be lost.

            Some people like to read books as a hobby. It is a great way to improve oneâ€™s vocabulary. This makes them aware of plenty of things that schools might not teach them. Life is short, and the world is vast. There is a galaxy of knowledge out there, waiting for us to stumble upon it. That is the main purpose of hobbies. To make us aware of things those are beyond the confines of our classroom walls.



            A regular school day will teach you only those topics that are mentioned in your syllabus. However, a hobby will teach you much more than that. It will introduce you to newer topics. This will help you in becoming a knowledgeable person.</p>
